    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">About Covid_19</h2>

    <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection" target="blank">infectious disease</a> caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2"target="blank"> severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</a>.The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, Central China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, and sore throat are less common.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms,some progress to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure.As of 20 March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.1%; however, it ranges from 0.2% to 15% depending on age and other health problems.

    The virus is typically spread from one person to another via respiratory droplets produced during coughing.It may also be spread from touching contaminated surfaces and then touching one's face.Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between two and 14 days, with an average of five days.The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia.
        
    Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, physical distancing (maintaining distance from others), and keeping hands away from the face.The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers, but not the general public.There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.
        
    The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).Evidence of local transmission of the disease has been found in many countries across all six WHO regions.</p>

    <br/>
    <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>

    <p>Although those infected with the virus may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier"target="blank">asymptomatic</a>, many develop flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be seen. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages among patients in several studies, with percentages varying from 3% to 31% of cases depending on the study.Some initial cases in China presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome"target="blank"> multi-organ failure</a>, and death.

    As is common with infections, there is a delay from when a person is infected with the virus to when they develop symptoms, known as the incubation period. The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to fourteen days.</p>

    <br/>
    <h2>Cause</h2>

    <p>
    The disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).It is primarily spread between people via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes.The virus can remain viable in aerosols for up to three hours, four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel.The virus has also been found in faeces, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal%E2%80%93oral_route"target="blank">transmission through faeces</a> is being researched.

    The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme ACE2, which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested that decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,though another view is that increasing ACE2 using Angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective and that these hypotheses need to be tested.As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.

    The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.The virus has been found in the faeces of as many as 53% of hospitalised people and more anal swab positives have been found than oral swab positives in the later stages of infection.Duration time of positive stool ranged from 1 to 12 days and 17% of people remained positive in stool after showing negative in respiratory samples indicating that the viral gastrointestinal infection and the potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in respiratory tract.Reoccurrence of the virus has also been detected through anal swabs suggesting a shift from more oral positive during the early stages of the disease to more anal positive during later periods.

    The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin,through spillover infection.It was first transmitted to humans in Wuhan, China, in November or December 2019, and the primary source of infection became human-to-human transmission by early January 2020.The earliest known infection occurred on 17 November 2019 in Wuhan, China.

    <br/>
    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

    <p>
    The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).The test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence"target="blank">genetic sequence</a> so that laboratories across the world could independently develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction"target="blank"> polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</a> tests to detect infection by the virus.As of 26 February 2020, there were no antibody tests or point-of-care tests though efforts to develop them are ongoing.

    Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.A study published by a team at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan on 26 February 2020 showed that a chest CT scan for COVID-19 has greater sensitivity (98%) than the polymerase chain reaction (71%).False negative results may occur due to PCR kit failure, or due to either issues with the sample or issues performing the test. False positive results are likely to be rare.

    One study in China found that CT scans showed ground-glass opacities in 56%, but 18% had no radiological findings.Bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacities are the most typical CT findings, though they are non-specific.Consolidation, linear opacities and reverse halo sign are other radiological findings.Initially, the lesions are confined to one lung, but as the disease progresses, indications manifest in both lungs in 88% of so-called "late patients" in the study group (the subset for whom time between onset of symptoms and chest CT was 6–12 days).Ground glass opacities are also a common feature in children's disease.

    <br/>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>

    <p>
    Because a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is not expected to become available until 2021 at the earliest,a key part of managing the COVID-19 pandemic is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve through various measures seeking to reduce the rate of new infections.Slowing the infection rate helps decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and provides more time for a vaccine and treatment to be developed.

    Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection in locations with an outbreak of the disease are similar to those published for other coronaviruses: stay home, avoid travel and public activities, wash hands with soap and warm water often and for at least 20 seconds (proper hand hygiene and also the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday to You" twice.), practice good respiratory hygiene and avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.The CDC recommends covering up the mouth and nose with a tissue during any cough or sneeze and coughing or sneezing into the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.They also recommend proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling mass gatherings.Social distancing also includes that people stay 6 feet apart (about 1.80 meters), roughly the length of a full size bed/mattress.

    According to the WHO, the use of masks is only recommended if a person is coughing or sneezing or when one is taking care of someone with a suspected infection.Some countries also recommend healthy individuals to wear face masks, particularly China,Hong Kong and Thailand.

    To prevent transmission of the virus, the CDC recommends that infected individuals stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask when exposed to an individual or location of a suspected infection, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. It further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For remote areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO suggested two formulations for the local production. In both of these formulations the antimicrobial activity of ethanol or isopropanol is enhanced by low concentration of hydrogen peroxide while glycerol acts as a humectant.The WHO advises individuals to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Spitting in public places also should be avoided.

    <br/>
    <h2>Management</h2>

    <p>
    People are managed with supportive care which may include fluid, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.Steroids such as methylprednisolone are not recommended unless the disease is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome.

    CDC recommends that those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[66][95] While WHO does not oppose the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen for symptoms,some recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) for first-line use.While theoretical concerns have been raised about ACE inhibitors, as of 19 March 2020 these are not sufficient to justify stopping these medications.

    The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.[99][100] Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h2>Personal protective equipment</h2>

    <p>
    Management of people infected by the virus includes taking precautions while applying therapeutic manoeuvres, especially when performing procedures like intubation or hand ventilation that can generate aerosols.

    CDC outlines the specific personal protective equipment and the order in which healthcare providers should put it on when dealing with someone who may have COVID-19: 1) gown, 2) mask or respirator,3) goggles or a face shield, 4) medical gloves.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h2>Mechanical ventilation</h2>

    <p>
    Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation (artificial assistance to support breathing), but a percentage of cases do.Some Canadian doctors recommend the use of invasive mechanical ventilation because this technique limits the spread of aerosolized transmission vectors.[108] Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years and especially those older than 80 years[citation needed]). Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.This limited capacity is a significant driver of the need to flatten the curve (to keep the speed at which new cases occur and thus the number of people sick at one point in time lower).One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.An Italian startup employed 3D printing technology to produce valves for life-saving coronavirus treatment due to a broken supply chain of original manufacturing.3D printed valves cost $1 instead of $11,000 and were ready overnight.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h2>Vaccine</h2>

    <p>
    There is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies. Previous work on SARS-CoV is being utilised because SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.There are three vaccination strategies being investigated. First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response"target="blank"> immune response</a> of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor. A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.

    On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle. The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.

    The difficulty with vaccine development is that older people who are most vulnerable to infection are poorly vaccinated due to age-related degradation of the thymus. Therefore, along with the development of a vaccine, it is necessary to develop ways to increase immunity in these people. One of these methods can be treatment with recombinant interleukin 7. Interleukin 7 plays an extremely important role in the maturation and reproduction of lymphoid cells. Therefore, it makes sense, along with vaccines, to develop methods for restoring the immune function in the elderly, for example, by improving it using treatment with recombinant interleukin 7.
